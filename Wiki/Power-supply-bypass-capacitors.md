# Power Supply Bypass capacitors

One recommended modification to the stock GBS board is to add more capacitance for power supply bypassing.
This step can reduce some forms of visible noise.

> Let's settle on 10uF for the large local storage caps, as more capacity seems to be at the upper end of current market offers.
> We want as high a voltage rating as possible, but that increases size. We want to limit size to 0805, so they can still be soldered besides the 0603 stocks.
> Ebay has some cheap listings for:
> 0805: 10V
> 0603: 6.3V
> Actual voltages are 3.3V for the main supply (C23 C41 C48), and 1.8V for the digital supply (C42).
